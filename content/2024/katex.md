## Announcing KaTeX Support: Easily Embed Mathematical Formulas in Bloggrify

Hello, readers! We have some exciting news for all the math enthusiasts and educators out there. Bloggrify now supports KaTeX, allowing you to seamlessly embed mathematical formulas and equations directly into your Markdown posts. This powerful new feature makes it easier than ever to create and share content that includes complex mathematical notation.

KaTeX is a fast, easy-to-use JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. It is a robust and efficient way to render mathematical formulas in your markdown files.

You can find more information on the [official website](https://katex.org/).

## Getting Started with KaTeX

### Mathematical formulas

**Centered formula**
$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

**Using code block**
```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
```

**Inline formula**

This is an inline formula $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Conclusion
With KaTeX support, Bloggrify opens up new possibilities for creating rich, educational content. Whether you're a teacher, a student, or just someone who loves math, this feature will help you communicate complex ideas more effectively.

We canâ€™t wait to see how you use KaTeX in your Bloggrify posts. Share your thoughts and creations with us, and stay tuned to Bloggrify for more updates and tutorials!
